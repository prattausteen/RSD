/*
2. Suppose a percent sign % represents the backspace key being pressed. Write a function that transforms a string containing % into a string without any %.

Examples

erase("he%%l%hel%llo") ➞ "hello"

erase("major% spar%%ks") ➞ "majo spks"

erase("si%%%t boy") ➞ "t boy"

erase("%%%%") ➞ ""

Notes

In addition to characters, backspaces can also remove whitespaces.

If the number of percent signs exceeds the previous characters, remove those previous characters entirely (see example #3).

If there only exist backspaces, return an empty string (see example #4).
